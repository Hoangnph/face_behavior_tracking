# Environment Setup - Task Completion Report

## Task Overview
- **Task**: Environment Setup
- **Status**: Completed
- **Completion Date**: April 11, 2024
- **Branch**: environment-setup

## Completed Subtasks
- [x] Set up development environment with required dependencies
- [x] Install and configure core libraries (OpenCV, NumPy, MediaPipe)
- [x] Setup testing frameworks and validation tools

## Implementation Details

### Environment Configuration
- Created `environment.yml` for conda environment setup
- Configured for both CPU and GPU environments (with CUDA support for compatible systems)
- Core dependencies:
  - Python 3.9+
  - OpenCV
  - NumPy
  - MediaPipe
  - ONNX Runtime
  - PyTorch and TorchVision
  - YOLOv8 (via Ultralytics)

### Setup Scripts
- Created `setup.sh` for Unix-based systems (Linux/macOS)
- Created `setup.bat` for Windows systems
- Implemented automated environment verification script (`setup_environment.py`)
- Created unit tests to verify environment functionality (`test_environment.py`)

### Documentation
- Created detailed environment setup guide (`docs/environment_setup.md`)
- Included troubleshooting information for common issues
- Added notes about optional components (ByteTrack)

## Testing Results
All core setup tests have been passed:
- Python version verification
- Core dependency installation
- MediaPipe model initialization
- YOLOv8 model loading
- Project structure validation

## Known Issues
- ByteTrack installation is problematic due to packaging issues. This component has been marked as optional for initial development and will be addressed in the tracking module implementation phase.

## Next Steps
- Proceed to "Video Input Pipeline" implementation
- Consider alternatives for ByteTrack if installation issues persist
