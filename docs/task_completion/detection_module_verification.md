# Detection Module Verification Report

## Test Environment
- **Hardware**: MacBook Pro
- **OS**: macOS 24.3.0
- **Date**: March 23, 2025

## Test Results

### Face Detection (MediaPipe)
- **Detection Rate**: 96.9% (31/32 sample images)
- **Average Speed**: 17.41 FPS
- **Effective FPS with Frame Skipping**: 17.59
- **Status**: ✅ PASSED (threshold: 90%)

### Person Detection (YOLOv8)
- **Detection Rate**: 66.7% (20/30 sample frames)
- **Average Persons per Frame**: 2.0
- **Average Speed**: 10.05 FPS
- **Effective FPS with Frame Skipping**: 10.15
- **Status**: ❌ FAILED (threshold: 70%)

### ONNX Runtime Integration
- **Performance**: 22.38 FPS
- **Effective FPS with Frame Skipping**: 22.61
- **Status**: ✅ PASSED (successfully integrated)
- **Note**: Outperforms native YOLOv8 implementation by 122.7%

### Detection Scheduler
- **Performance**: 6.87 FPS
- **Effective FPS with Frame Skipping**: 6.94
- **Status**: ✅ FUNCTIONING (but below target real-time performance)

## Optimizations Applied
1. Reduced confidence threshold to 0.15 for YOLOv8 detection
2. Increased size factor to 0.75 for better accuracy
3. Used standard input size (640x640) for YOLOv8
4. Implemented aspect ratio-preserving resize
5. Added ONNX integration for improved performance

## Performance Analysis
- Face detection meets performance requirements (>15 FPS)
- Person detection shows lower than required accuracy (66.7% vs 70%)
- Person detection with YOLOv8 is below real-time requirements (<15 FPS)
- ONNX implementation performs significantly better than native YOLOv8
- Detection scheduler overall performance is still below real-time requirements

## Known Issues
1. Person detection accuracy (66.7%) is below the required 70% threshold
2. YOLOv8 inference speed (10.05 FPS) is below the required 15 FPS
3. Combined detection schedule speed (6.87 FPS) is well below real-time requirements
4. Current optimizations affect accuracy and performance trade-offs

## Recommendations
1. **Improve Person Detection**:
   - Try YOLOv8n-pose model specifically designed for human detection
   - Further reduce confidence threshold for detection (e.g., 0.1)
   - Implement multi-scale detection for better coverage of different sizes
   - Consider additional models specifically trained for human detection

2. **Performance Improvements**:
   - Fully implement and optimize ONNX Runtime execution
   - Add TensorRT integration for NVIDIA GPUs
   - Add CoreML integration for Apple Silicon
   - Add OpenCL support for AMD GPUs
   - Consider quantized models for faster inference

3. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Use more diverse test data with different lighting and camera angles
   - Test with videos of varying resolutions
   - Add test cases for crowded scenes
   - Add occlusion testing
