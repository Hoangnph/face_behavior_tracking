# Detection Module Improvement Project

## Summary of Accomplishments

As of March 23, 2025, we have successfully improved the detection module with the following achievements:

1. **Fixed ONNX Detector Issues**:
   - Resolved error handling for input dimensions in `ONNXDetector`
   - Added proper error handling for symbolic dimensions
   - Implemented fallback to default dimensions (640x640) when parsing fails
   - Added debug logging for troubleshooting

2. **Optimized Person Detection**:
   - Reduced confidence threshold from 0.5 to 0.15 for better detection rate
   - Implemented improved image resizing with aspect ratio preservation
   - Optimized input size for YOLOv8 detection (640x640)
   - Increased size factor to 0.75 for better balance of speed and accuracy

3. **Performance Improvements**:
   - Successfully integrated ONNX runtime with 22.47 FPS (117% faster than YOLOv8)
   - Fixed issues in preprocessing and post-processing

4. **Testing and Documentation**:
   - All 21 unit tests now pass successfully
   - Created comprehensive verification report
   - Developed next steps documentation
   - Implemented demo script for visual verification

## Current Status

| Component | Status | Performance | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-------|
| Face Detection | ✅ PASSED | 17.27 FPS | 96.9% detection rate (exceeds 90% target) |
| Person Detection | ❌ NEEDS IMPROVEMENT | 10.33 FPS | 66.7% detection rate (below 70% target) |
| ONNX Integration | ✅ PASSED | 22.47 FPS | Successfully integrated |
| Overall Scheduler | ⚠️ BELOW TARGET | 6.55 FPS | Below real-time requirements |

## Key Metrics Comparison

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Unit Tests | 15/21 passed | 21/21 passed | +6 tests |
| Face Detection Rate | 96.9% | 96.9% | No change |
| Person Detection Rate | 63.3% | 66.7% | +3.4% |
| Person Detection FPS | ~9 FPS | 10.33 FPS | +14.8% |
| ONNX Integration | Failed | 22.47 FPS | Fixed |

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Further Improve Person Detection**:
   - Try YOLOv8n-pose model specifically for human detection
   - Test with confidence threshold of 0.1
   - Implement multi-scale detection for better coverage

2. **Optimize Performance**:
   - Fully optimize ONNX runtime execution
   - Implement hardware acceleration where available
   - Profile the detection pipeline for bottlenecks

3. **Testing Improvements**:
   - Create more diverse test datasets
   - Add performance benchmarking across different hardware
   - Complete personal verification required by project rules

## Conclusion

The detection module has been significantly improved, with all unit tests now passing and ONNX integration fixed. While face detection meets all requirements, person detection still needs further work to meet the 70% detection rate target and 15 FPS performance requirement. The ONNX implementation provides a promising path forward for performance optimization, achieving more than double the FPS of the base YOLOv8 implementation.
