# Next Steps for Detection Module Improvement

This document outlines the next steps to improve the detection module's performance and accuracy based on verification results.

## Current Status

As of March 23, 2025:

- **Face Detection**: ✅ PASSED
  - 96.9% detection rate (above 90% threshold)
  - 17.41 FPS (above 15 FPS requirement)

- **Person Detection**: ❌ NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
  - 66.7% detection rate (below 70% threshold)
  - 10.05 FPS (below 15 FPS requirement)

- **ONNX Runtime**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
  - 22.38 FPS (exceeds YOLOv8 performance)
  - Successfully integrated with detection pipeline

- **Overall Detection Scheduler**: ⚠️ BELOW TARGET
  - 6.87 FPS (well below real-time requirements)

## High Priority Tasks

1. **Improve Person Detection Accuracy**:
   - [ ] Test with YOLOv8n-pose model (specific for human pose estimation)
   - [ ] Further tune confidence threshold (try 0.1)
   - [ ] Implement multi-scale detection strategy
   - [ ] Test different NMS (Non-Maximum Suppression) thresholds

2. **Improve Performance**:
   - [ ] Complete ONNX Runtime optimization
   - [ ] Implement CUDA/TensorRT support for NVIDIA GPUs
   - [ ] Implement CoreML support for Apple Silicon
   - [ ] Profile detection pipeline to identify bottlenecks
   - [ ] Implement model quantization (INT8/FP16)

3. **Improve Testing and Verification**:
   - [ ] Create more diverse test datasets
   - [ ] Add performance benchmarking across different hardware
   - [ ] Create comprehensive test cases document
   - [ ] Complete personal verification required by @big-project.mdc rule

## Medium Priority Tasks

1. **Code Optimization**:
   - [ ] Refactor detection module for better parallelization
   - [ ] Implement batch processing for multiple frames
   - [ ] Optimize preprocessing steps (resizing, normalization)
   - [ ] Implement adaptive resolution based on performance

2. **Documentation**:
   - [ ] Update API documentation
   - [ ] Create performance comparison charts
   - [ ] Document configuration recommendations for different hardware

## Additional Considerations

1. **Alternative Models to Investigate**:
   - [ ] ByteTrack or StrongSORT for improved tracking
   - [ ] YOLOv8m for higher accuracy (trade-off: lower speed)
   - [ ] MobileNetSSD for potential performance gains
   - [ ] TinyYOLO variants for better speed/accuracy trade-offs

2. **GPU Acceleration**:
   - [ ] Benchmark performance across different GPUs
   - [ ] Compare CUDA vs OpenCL vs Metal performance
   - [ ] Investigate CPU vs GPU memory transfer optimizations
