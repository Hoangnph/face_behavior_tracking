# Updated Test Requirements for Tasks 3-8

This document outlines the updated test requirements for the human tracking and behavior analysis system (Tasks 3-8) to ensure consistent use of project datasets and proper verification processes.

## Common Requirements for All Tasks

1. **Standard Data Sources:**
   - **Face Detection/Recognition**: Use faces from `data/faces/known_customers` and `data/faces/employees` directories
   - **Person Detection/Tracking**: Use the sample video from `data/videos/sample_2.mp4`
   - **Performance Testing**: All benchmarks should be measured on `data/videos/sample_2.mp4`

2. **Verification Process (Following @big-project.mdc rule):**
   All tasks must pass both automated tests and personal verification:

   - **Automated Testing**:
     - All unit tests must pass
     - Performance benchmarks must meet specified thresholds
     - No critical errors or exceptions during processing

   - **Personal Verification**:
     - Visual inspection of results on sample data
     - Confirmation of accuracy in challenging cases
     - Verification of proper functionality
     - Sign-off on performance metrics meeting project requirements

3. **Test Result Documentation Requirements:**
   Each completed task must include comprehensive documentation:
   
   ```

## Task 3: Detection Module

### Updated Test Requirements
- Face detection should identify faces with at least 90% accuracy on the `data/faces` dataset
- Person detection should identify people in `data/videos/sample_2.mp4` with at least 80% accuracy
- ONNX models should run at least 20% faster than original models
- Detection should work in real-time (minimum 15 FPS) for 640x480 resolution

### Verification Points
- Face detection correctly identifies faces in the sample dataset
- Person detection accurately tracks people in the sample video
- The performance meets project requirements
- All known issues have been documented

## Task 4: Tracking Module

### Updated Test Requirements
- ByteTrack should maintain consistent IDs for individuals across frames in `data/videos/sample_2.mp4`
- People should keep the same ID even after brief occlusion (< 30 frames)
- ID switches should be minimal (< 5% of total tracks)
- Tracking should operate at real-time speeds (> 20 FPS) for 640x480 resolution

### Verification Points
- People maintain consistent IDs throughout the video when visible
- The tracking successfully handles occlusion and reappearance
- The performance meets real-time requirements
- All known issues have been documented

## Task 5: Pose Estimation

### Updated Test Requirements
- MediaPipe pose estimation should detect and track key body points in `data/videos/sample_2.mp4`
- Face landmarks should be accurately detected for faces in `data/faces` dataset
- Pose estimation should maintain temporal consistency across video frames
- Processing should achieve at least 15 FPS on 640x480 resolution

### Verification Points
- Body keypoints are accurately detected and aligned with human anatomy
- Face landmarks match facial features in the sample dataset
- Pose tracking is stable and consistent across video frames
- The performance is suitable for real-time applications

## Task 6: Behavior Analysis

### Updated Test Requirements
- Feature extraction should work correctly on poses from `data/videos/sample_2.mp4`
- Rule-based behavior classification should identify standard postures/activities
- Temporal pattern analysis should detect consistent behaviors over time
- The analysis should process video at minimum 10 FPS

### Verification Points
- Features accurately represent human postures and movements
- Behavior classification correctly identifies common activities
- Temporal patterns are detected with reasonable accuracy
- The system handles edge cases appropriately

## Task 7: Visualization

### Updated Test Requirements
- Real-time visualization should clearly display detection results from `data/videos/sample_2.mp4`
- Visualization components should be configurable for different levels of detail
- Export formats (JSON, CSV) should contain all relevant tracking/analysis data
- Video recording with annotations should maintain source video quality

### Verification Points
- Visualizations clearly represent detection and tracking results
- The interface provides useful configuration options
- Exported data contains all necessary information for analysis
- Recorded videos with annotations are clear and informative

## Task 8: Performance Optimization

### Updated Test Requirements
- Multi-threading model should improve processing speed by at least 30% on `data/videos/sample_2.mp4`
- Memory usage should remain stable during long-running processing
- System should automatically balance accuracy vs. speed based on hardware capabilities
- Load adaptation mechanisms should handle varying complexity in video content

### Verification Points
- Multi-threading significantly improves overall performance
- Memory usage remains stable during extended operation
- The system can adapt to different hardware environments
- Load adaptation successfully handles varying video complexity

## Summary

These updated test requirements ensure that all components are tested against the same standardized datasets (`data/faces` and `data/videos/sample_2.mp4`), making integration testing more consistent and reliable. Following the @big-project.mdc rule, each task requires personal verification and comprehensive documentation before being considered complete.

All verification artifacts (images, videos, performance logs) should be saved to the `data/output/verification` directory for review.
