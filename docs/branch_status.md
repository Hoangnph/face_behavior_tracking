## Current Branches

As of March 23, 2025, the project contains the following branches:

| Branch Name | Status | Description | Last Commit |
|-------------|--------|-------------|------------|
| master | Current | Main development branch | a1d8d8c - Finalize detection module verification and task overview |
| tracking-module-development | Active | New branch for tracking module implementation | a1d8d8c - Finalize detection module verification and task overview |
| release-detection-module | Complete | Release branch for detection module | a1d8d8c - Finalize detection module verification and task overview |
| fix-person-detection | Merged | Fixes for person detection functionality | e80ce46 - Fix detection module issues and improve performance |

## Synchronization Status

The local `master` branch is ahead of the remote `origin/master` by 22 commits. There are issues with pushing to the remote repository:

```
Error: RPC failed; HTTP 500 curl 22 The requested URL returned error: 500
send-pack: unexpected disconnect while reading sideband packet
```

### Resolution Plan

1. Created a Git bundle file to store all changes: `detection-module-bundle.bundle`
2. This bundle contains all commits from the `master` branch and can be used to transfer changes to another repository or to restore the state if needed
3. Created a new `tracking-module-development` branch for continuing work on the next module

### Next Steps for Git Management

1. Work on the new `tracking-module-development` branch for all future development
2. Attempt to push to remote repository later when server issues are resolved
3. If remote push continues to fail, consider:
   - Setting up an alternative remote repository
   - Using the bundle file to transfer changes
   - Investigating network or server-side issues

## Completed Milestones in Current Branch

The current branch contains all completed work for:

1. Environment Setup (100%)
2. Video Input Pipeline (100%)
3. Detection Module (100%)

All documentation has been updated to reflect the current state of the project, and the repository structure is ready for the next phase of development (Tracking Module).
