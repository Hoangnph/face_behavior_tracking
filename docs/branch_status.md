## Synchronization Status

**UPDATE**: The synchronization issue has been resolved. All branches have been successfully pushed to the remote repository.

Previously, there were issues pushing to the remote repository with the following error:

```
Error: RPC failed; HTTP 500 curl 22 The requested URL returned error: 500
send-pack: unexpected disconnect while reading sideband packet
```

### Resolution Applied

1. Increased Git HTTP buffer sizes:
   ```
   git config http.postBuffer 524288000
   git config http.maxRequestBuffer 104857600
   ```

2. Successfully pushed all branches to GitHub:
   - master
   - tracking-module-development
   - release-detection-module

3. Repository is now fully synchronized with remote at: https://github.com/Hoangnph/face_behavior_tracking.git

### Git Bundle 

The Git bundle file `detection-module-bundle.bundle` created earlier can be safely archived or deleted as it is no longer needed for synchronization purposes.

## Current Development Status

The development continues on the `tracking-module-development` branch, which has been set up to track the remote branch `origin/tracking-module-development`.

## Completed Milestones in Current Branch

The current branch contains all completed work for:

1. Environment Setup (100%)
2. Video Input Pipeline (100%)
3. Detection Module (100%)

All documentation has been updated to reflect the current state of the project, and the repository structure is ready for the next phase of development (Tracking Module).
