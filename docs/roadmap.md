| Person detection accuracy below target | High | Investigate alternative models, adjust confidence thresholds, improve preprocessing |
| Overall system performance below real-time requirements | High | Implement scheduling strategies, optimize critical components, consider hardware acceleration |
| Integration complexities between detection and tracking | Medium | Design clear interfaces, comprehensive testing, incremental integration |
| Resource constraints on target platforms | Medium | Profile resource usage, implement optimizations for target hardware |

## Next Steps

1. Complete integration of tracking module with detection module
2. Begin identity management implementation with face recognition
3. Continue tracking optimization for crowded scenes
4. Update system architecture documentation
